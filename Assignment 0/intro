Hello,
	If it isn't obvious from the file name, my name is Laharish. I'm studying for my B.Tech degree in Information Technology from National Institute of Technology, Surathkal. Currently, I've finished my first year of college and waiting to start my second year. I have no special talents as I am just average in just about everything. I hope that I'll have fun in the SMP. Thank you.
